A race begins between a rabbit and a tortoise in a sunny meadow.
The rabbit dashes ahead confidently while the tortoise keeps a steady pace.
The rabbit pauses to rest under a tree, assuming victory is certain.
The tortoise continues moving calmly and passes the sleeping rabbit.
The rabbit wakes up and sprints, but the tortoise crosses the finish line first.
